# MultiLevelInheritanceExample

Multi-Level Inheritance Example in Java
ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project demonstrates Multi-Level Inheritance in Java, where a child class (Child1) inherits from a parent class (Parent1), which itself inherits from a grandparent class (GrandParent).

It shows:

How properties and methods are passed down through multiple levels of inheritance.

How a single object (Child1) can access attributes and behaviors from its parent and grandparent classes.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
GrandParent class:

Property: lastName (String)

Method: message1() (Prints a message from the grandparent)

Parent1 class (extends GrandParent):

Property: parentJob (String)

Method: message2() (Prints a message from the parent)

Child1 class (extends Parent1):

Property: school (String)

Method: message3() (Prints a message from the child)

MultiLevelInheritanceExample class:

Contains the main() method.

Creates an instance of Child1.

Demonstrates accessing properties and methods across three levels: Child â†’ Parent â†’ Grandparent.

ðŸš€ How It Works
An object of Child1 is created.

Through inheritance:

It accesses its own fields (school) and methods (message3()).

It accesses inherited fields (parentJob) and methods (message2()) from Parent1.

It also accesses inherited fields (lastName) and methods (message1()) from GrandParent.

Child's school is: Greenwood High School
Message from Child
Parents Job: Engineer
Message from Parent
